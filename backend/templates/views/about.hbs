              <h2>The Adventures of ThemeIsle</h2>
              
              <p>
                After a month they had their new approach to WordPress themes:
                build one store with themes built for specific purposes without
                the feature burden that made learning WordPress a chore. They
                started with little money, few skills, and no knowledge but they
                were willing to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, for our hearty crew this marked the beginning of their
                adventure on the high-seas.

                  They quickly learned to adapt, three years without a sale will
                  do that, but, finally, learnin’ the ways o’the ‘Press paid off
                  when the Legend of Zerif (Zelle) arrived in 2015.

                  While Zerif wasn’t perfect, it was soon moored to the popular
                  themes chart in the WordPress repo. Legend has it that it can
                  still be found sailing on over 100k sites to this day.

            <h1>The beliefs Daily Dose is founded upon</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We don’t have to be a great writer or be super smart to become a
                successful content creator or start a business. But if we adopt
                a learning mindset and putting in plenty of time, and hard work
                – we can accomplish anything.
              </li>
              <li>
                We don’t have to be chained to our business 24/7 to make them
                successful (but be prepared to work a lot to get it off the
                ground) – by working smarter we can ensure we spend more times
                with those we love.
              </li>
              <li>
                While there are countless institutions focused on driving people
                apart – blogging can bring us together.
              </li>
              <li>
                As content creators we can become real change agents, and make a
                difference one person at our time – right from our armchair.
                Like Gandhi says; “be the change that you wish to see in the
                world”.
